            <img src="images/Japanese Chicken Curry.jpg" width="400" alt=" Orange curry with chicken and carrots on left half of plate, 
            white rice on right half">

            <p>Unlike Indian or Thai curry, Japanese curry is more savory than spicy. Its an exemplary comfort food and
                one of the most-loved home-cooked dishes in Japan.</p>
            <h3>Recipe Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 package curry sauce mix</li>
                <li>1 can peas</li>
                <li>5 new potatoes, halved</li>
                <li>1 package sliced cremini mushrooms</li>
                <li>2 medium carrots, chopped</li>
                <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
                <li>2 cups jasmine rice</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place chicken in a large, deep skillet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper on
                    both sides.
                    Add 1/3 cup water to the pan, cover, and cook over medium heat until no longer pink in the center
                    and the
                    juices run clear, about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>While chicken is cooking, pour 2 cups water into a microwave-safe bowl. Break curry sauce mix into
                    pieces and
                    add to water. Heat in the microwave on high for 3 1/2 minutes; remove and stir until sauce mix has
                    completely dissolved.</li>
                <li>Remove chicken from the skillet. Cut into cubes, return to the skillet, and pour curry sauce over
                    top.
                    Stir in peas, potatoes, mushrooms, carrots, and onion. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer
                    until vegetables
                    are tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, bring remaining water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover,
                    and simmer
                    until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Scoop rice into bowls and serve curry on top</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Mac & Cheese</h2>
            <img src="images/mac&cheese.jpg" width="400" alt="A plate of Mac & Cheese with a wooden spoon">

            <p>Macaroni and cheese, commonly known as mac & cheese, is a comfort food staple that has captured the
                hearts of people all over the world. Originating from Europe and popularized in the United States, this
                dish consists of elbow macaroni pasta smothered in a creamy cheese sauce. The simplicity of its
                ingredients—pasta, cheese, and often a touch of butter or milk—belies a rich, complex flavor that has
                made it a favorite for both quick weeknight dinners and festive holiday gatherings.</p>

            <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375°. Grease a 13"x9" baking dish with butter. In a large pot of boiling salted
                    water, cook macaroni, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain.</li>
                <li>In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt 1 stick butter. Sprinkle flour over and cook, stirring,
                    until slightly golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in milk and whisk until combined. Add mustard powder;
                    season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook, stirring, until sauce
                    starts to thicken, about 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove pan from heat and whisk in cheddar, Gruyère, and 1 cup Parmesan until melted and smooth. Stir
                    in macaroni and transfer to the prepared dish.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, combine panko, oil, and remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan. Sprinkle over macaroni; season
                    with more pepper.</li>
                <li>Bake mac and cheese until bubbly and golden, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes.</li>
